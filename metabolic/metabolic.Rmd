## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
df = data.frame(kcal_kg_day=c(18.8,20.0,20.1,20.9,20.9,21.4,22.0,22.7,22.9,23.0,24.5,25.8,30.0,37.6,38.5), group=c("non_trauma","non_trauma","non_trauma","non_trauma","non_trauma","non_trauma","trauma","non_trauma","non_trauma","trauma","trauma","trauma","trauma","trauma","trauma"))

df
